# ABOUT THE EXTENSIONS SYSTEM

### Extension Install File Format
The extension installation file is generated by calling `ExtensionInstaller.DumpInstallData`, with the only parameter being an extension type.

The whole thing is done via reflection, and maps command data and a few other bits of info by a few key parameters and attributes. The following are the required things it looks for:

* **Name** property defined in the main extension class.
* An attribute on each command-handling method of type `CommandHandlerAttribute` and a value of a unique string. This string is extension-unique, not global. (For example, two different extensions can register a _topic_ command handler.
 
The extension loader then looks through the compiled binary file in the following way:

* A `string` holding the extension name.
* A `16-byte guid array` that holds the extension's unique identifier.
* A `short` that holds how many command mappings follow the short.
* A list of extension command maps. These are in the format of a `string` followed by a `16-byte guid array` that represents a method identifier, much in the same way as the extension identifier.
